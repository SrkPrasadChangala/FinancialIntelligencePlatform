Design and implement a Market Sentiment Dashboard that aggregates and visualizes various data sources to provide a comprehensive view of market sentiment.

The dashboard should:

**1. Data Sources and Integration:**

*   **News Sentiment:** Integrate with news APIs or web scraping techniques to collect news articles related to specific stocks, sectors, or the overall market. Implement Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques (e.g., sentiment analysis using pre-trained models like VADER or FinBERT) to quantify the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) expressed in these articles.
*   **Social Media Sentiment:** Collect data from social media platforms (e.g., Twitter, StockTwits, Reddit) using their APIs. Use NLP to analyze the sentiment expressed in posts and comments related to financial markets.
*   **Volatility Indices:** Integrate data on volatility indices like the VIX (CBOE Volatility Index) to provide a measure of market fear and uncertainty.
*   **Analyst Ratings:** Collect data on analyst ratings (buy, sell, hold) and price targets for individual stocks.
*   **Trading Volume and Price Action:** Include data on trading volume, price changes, and other technical indicators to provide context for sentiment analysis.
*   **Economic Indicators:** Optionally, incorporate key economic indicators (e.g., GDP growth, inflation, unemployment) to provide a broader macroeconomic context.

**2. Data Processing and Aggregation:**

*   Implement data cleaning and preprocessing steps to handle noisy or inconsistent data.
*   Aggregate sentiment scores from different sources to create composite sentiment indicators for specific stocks, sectors, and the overall market.
*   Implement time series analysis to track changes in sentiment over time.

**3. Visualization and User Interface:**

*   **Overall Market Sentiment:** Display a summary of overall market sentiment using a clear and concise visual representation (e.g., a gauge, a sentiment score, a color-coded indicator).
*   **Sector-Specific Sentiment:** Provide a breakdown of sentiment by sector (e.g., technology, healthcare, financials) using charts or heatmaps.
*   **Individual Stock Sentiment:** Allow users to search for specific stocks and view their sentiment scores, news sentiment, social media sentiment, analyst ratings, and other relevant data.
*   **Time Series Charts:** Display historical sentiment data using line charts or other appropriate visualizations to show trends and patterns.
*   **Interactive Elements:** Implement interactive elements such as filters, dropdown menus, and tooltips to allow users to explore the data in more detail.
*   **Real-time Updates:** Implement real-time or near real-time data updates to keep the dashboard current.
